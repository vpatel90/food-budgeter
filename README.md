This is a personal budgeter app

### Contribution Guide

- [Issues](https://github.com/vpatel90/food-budgeter/issues) are stories for bugs/features that I or anyone else can add here.

- Once an Issue is created, add it to the TODO of [projects/main](https://github.com/vpatel90/food-budgeter/projects/1)

- I will go through these from time to time prioritizing

- When you start working on an Issue, assign it to yourself and add comments on how you plan on implementing that specific story

- Locally, you will want to create a new git branch off of your master branch

- Once the code is ready, push it to git up and open a Pull Request to master

- I will review and eitehr request changes or approve

- Don't write code directly to master, you wont be able to push to origin master

- If you feel like there is a feature/enhancement that you would like to add - feel free to add it to the Issues list
